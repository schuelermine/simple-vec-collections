A `Vec`-backed reimplementation of Rustâ€™s `std::collections::HashMap`, as close as possible

This is a mostly API-compatible reimplementation of `std::collections::HashMap`.
Some inherent methods that provide hash-based functionality have been removed, some trait bounds have been removed, the `Debug` implementation has been altered for some types.
